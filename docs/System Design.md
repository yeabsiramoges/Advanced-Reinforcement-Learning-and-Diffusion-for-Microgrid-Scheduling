### Existing Environment Models
- https://farama.org/projects
## Training
Will include some mix of synthetic data and public data shown above in sources.
## Production
- Will have access to both batch and real-time data for training and modeling
## Labeling
- Looking to incorporate more than just the loads, want weather data and consumption when available.
    - Data of this format is found in the case strudies
## Features
- Labels are all numerically encoded across all datasets present.
